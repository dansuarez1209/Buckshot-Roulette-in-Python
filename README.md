# Buckshot-Roulette-in-Python
Text-based game based in the popular game "Buckshot Roulette" created by Mike Klubnika.
# Directions/How to use
In order to start, a name for the player must be typed. An item list from the player and 
the "Dealer" will be shown. You will have to type one of the shown items in order to advance
or type "revolver" in order to shoot the Dealer. The magnifying glass can be used to know if
the shot is blank or live. The beer can be used in order to skip the current shot while
keeping the turn. The saw can be used to double the damage of the shot if it is live.
The handcuffs can be used to have a double turn, no matter if the shot is blank.
After typing revolver, you can type "dealer" to shoot to the Dealer or your name to shoot
to yourself, which you can use if you know that the shot is blank or to take a chance.
The objective of the game is to kill the Dealer. That's all!
